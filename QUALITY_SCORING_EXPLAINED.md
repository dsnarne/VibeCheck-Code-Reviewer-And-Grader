# ðŸ“Š Quality Scoring Status

## Current Situation:

All files show quality score of **100** because:
- âœ… No issues detected in the analysis
- âœ… Database shows 0 issues in score_issues
- âœ… File analysis has empty issues arrays

## This is Normal:

If the code is **actually good quality** with no issues detected, then **100 is correct**!

## To See Lower Scores:

When issues ARE detected (like exposed API keys, missing type hints, etc.), the scores will drop:
- **Exposed API key**: -15 points â†’ score = 85
- **Missing type hints**: -5 points â†’ score = 95  
- **3 warnings**: -15 points â†’ score = 85

## Scoring Formula:

- Base score: **100**
- Each **error/high** issue: **-15 points**
- Each **warning/medium** issue: **-5 points**
- Each **info/low** issue: **-1 point**

## The Issue Highlighting Still Works:

Even if scores are 100, when you click "View File", you'll still see:
- âœ… Code displayed with line numbers
- âœ… Issues highlighted if they exist
- âœ… Color-coded borders for problematic lines
- âœ… Badges showing categories

## Summary:

**Quality scores of 100 = Good!** It means the analysis didn't find any issues. Once issues are detected, scores will automatically adjust!
