# 🔍 DEBUGGING RESULTS

## Problem Found:

When analyzing `https://github.com/dsnarne/VibeCheck-Code-Reviewer-And-Grader`:

```
✅ Analysis works - commits, languages, team data retrieved
❌ Files NOT stored - file_storage: null
❌ repo_id: null (not saved to database)
❌ files_stored: false
```

## Why This Happens:

The backend is trying to extract files but failing silently. The analysis continues but files never get uploaded to Supabase storage.

## Workaround Solution:

Instead of showing mock data, let's make the UI handle the "no files" case gracefully.

## What I'll Do:

1. ✅ Check if files exist before showing file list
2. ✅ Show a helpful message when no files are available
3. ✅ Add better error messages to help debug

This way:
- If files ARE stored → Works normally
- If files AREN'T stored → Shows a helpful message instead of crashing
