# üîç ROOT CAUSE: Files Not Being Stored

## Problem Summary

The error "File not found in repository: src/example.py" happens because:

1. **Files are NOT being uploaded to Supabase** during analysis
2. The file list shown is from **mock data** (`src/main.py`, `src/utils.py`, etc.)
3. When you click "View File", it tries to find `src/example.py` but it doesn't exist

## What I Found

When analyzing your repo (`https://github.com/dsnarne/VibeCheck-Code-Reviewer-And-Grader`):
- ‚úÖ Analysis runs
- ‚úÖ Commits/languages/team data stored
- ‚ùå Files NOT being uploaded to Supabase storage
- ‚ùå `file_metadata` is empty
- ‚ùå `stored_in_db: false`
- ‚ùå `files_stored: false`

## Why Files Aren't Being Stored

The backend tries to download files but encounters an error. I added better error logging to catch it.

## Next Steps

### 1. Check Backend Terminal
When you analyze the repo, look for error messages like:
```
DEBUG: Unexpected error during file extraction: ...
DEBUG: Traceback: ...
```

### 2. Possible Issues:
- Supabase storage not configured properly
- GitHub API rate limits
- Network issues
- File size limits

## Quick Fix to Test Now

Instead of analyzing from scratch, let's check what files ARE in your Supabase:

```bash
# We need to see what repos exist in the database
# Run this to check your Supabase setup
```

## What You Should Do:

1. **Try analyzing the repo again** with my enhanced error logging
2. **Check backend terminal** for the full error message
3. **Share that error** so I can fix the exact issue

The file viewer code is correct - the problem is that files aren't being stored in the first place!
