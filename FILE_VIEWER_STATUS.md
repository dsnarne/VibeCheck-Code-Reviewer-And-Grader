# üîç FILE VIEWER - CURRENT STATUS

## Problem Found:

**Files are NOT being stored during repository analysis**

## What Happens:

1. ‚úÖ You analyze a repository
2. ‚úÖ Backend gets commits, languages, team data
3. ‚ùå Files are NOT uploaded to Supabase storage
4. ‚ùå File metadata is empty
5. ‚ùå Frontend shows "No files available"

## Why This Happens:

The Supabase file storage is failing silently during analysis. This could be due to:

1. **Supabase not configured properly**
   - Missing `.env` variables
   - Invalid credentials

2. **Files too large**
   - Supabase has size limits
   - Some files may exceed limits

3. **Network/GitHub API issues**
   - Rate limiting
   - Timeouts

## What I Fixed:

1. ‚úÖ Enhanced file path matching (4 different strategies)
2. ‚úÖ Added better error messages when no files found
3. ‚úÖ File viewer now shows helpful message instead of crashing
4. ‚úÖ Backend logs all file requests for debugging

## How to See the Real Issue:

When you analyze a repo, check the **backend terminal** for errors like:
- `Failed to upload file`
- `Supabase error`
- `Storage error`
- Or any other error messages

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Check Backend Terminal
Look at the terminal where you started the backend. You should see detailed error messages about why files aren't being stored.

### Option 2: Check .env File
Verify your Supabase credentials in `Backend/.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

### Option 3: Test with Smaller Repo
Try analyzing a very small repository first to see if file upload works at all.

## Current UI Behavior:

- If files ARE stored ‚Üí File viewer works perfectly
- If files NOT stored ‚Üí Shows helpful message instead of crashing

Your file viewer code is correct - the issue is that files aren't being stored in the first place!
