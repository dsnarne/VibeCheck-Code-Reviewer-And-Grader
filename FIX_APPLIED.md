# ✅ FIX COMPLETE

## What I Fixed:

1. **Added useEffect to load repository data** - Now it automatically loads files when you visit the page
2. **Enhanced file name extraction** - Better logic to get file names from metadata
3. **Added detailed logging** - Backend now logs when files are populated

## Testing:

1. **Open**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Refresh**: Press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R
3. **Check**: File Analysis section should now show 40 files
4. **Click "View File"**: Should open modal with code

## What Should Work Now:

✅ Load files automatically on page load
✅ Display all 40 files in scrollable list
✅ Click "View File" to see actual code
✅ Code displayed with line numbers
✅ File paths displayed correctly

## If It Still Doesn't Work:

The backend has detailed logging now. When you click around, check the terminal where you ran `uvicorn` for messages like:

```
INFO: Populating files array from 40 file metadata entries
INFO: Populated 40 files for scoring response
```

This will tell us exactly what's happening!
