# 📺 How to See Backend Logs

## Your Backend IS Running

The backend is already running in a terminal window somewhere on your screen.

## 🔍 Find It:

1. **Look for a terminal window** with this in the title or visible text:
   - `uvicorn main:app --reload`
   - `VibeCheck`
   - Or Python code scrolling

2. **Check your terminal tabs** - you might have multiple terminals open

3. **That terminal shows all backend logs** - all errors appear there

## 📝 What You'll See When You Click "View File":

When you click "View File" in the browser, the backend terminal will show:
```
INFO: === File Download Request ===
INFO: Requested file_path: 'src/example.py'
INFO: Available files in metadata: ...
```

## 💡 Alternative: I Can Add Logging

If you can't find that terminal, I can:
1. Add better error messages directly to the API responses
2. Show you exactly what files ARE available
3. Fix the path matching issue

Would you like me to add better error handling so you see what's wrong without needing the terminal logs?
