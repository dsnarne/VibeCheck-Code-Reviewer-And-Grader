# ðŸŽ‰ ISSUE HIGHLIGHTING COMPLETE!

## What I Added:

1. **Enhanced FileViewer** with issue highlighting:
   - Visual highlighting on lines with issues
   - Color-coded by severity (red for critical/error, orange for warning)
   - Issue badges next to problematic lines
   - Issues summary panel at top

2. **Smart File Loading** in FileList:
   - Automatically fetches issues for each file
   - Matches issues to file paths
   - Passes issues to FileViewer

## How It Works:

1. When you click "View File" on any file
2. FileViewer loads the file content AND issues for that file
3. Lines with issues are highlighted with color-coded borders
4. Badges show category (Security, Quality, etc.)
5. Issues panel at top lists all problems with line numbers

## Visual Features:

- **Red highlighting**: Critical issues (exposed API keys, security vulnerabilities)
- **Orange highlighting**: Warnings (code quality issues)
- **Issue badges**: Shows category and severity
- **Line highlighting**: Left border on problematic lines
- **Issues summary**: Scrollable list at top of viewer

## Example:

If line 42 has an exposed API key:
- Line will be highlighted in red
- Badge will show "Security: error"
- Issues panel will say "Line 42: Exposed API key"

## Test It:

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Click "View File" on any file
3. See issues highlighted in the code!

The highlighting works automatically for any issues detected in the analysis!
