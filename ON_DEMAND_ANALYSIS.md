# ðŸŽ‰ ON-DEMAND FILE ANALYSIS COMPLETE!

## What I Added:

### 1. **Real-Time File Analysis**
- New endpoint: `/api/repos/{repo_id}/files/{file_path}/analyze`
- Analyzes file when you click "View File"
- Returns quality score based on actual code issues

### 2. **Accurate Quality Scoring**
- Each file gets analyzed on-demand
- Issues detected: missing type hints, exposed secrets, etc.
- Quality score calculated: -15 for errors, -5 for warnings

### 3. **How It Works:**

1. You click "View File" on any file
2. Backend downloads file content from Supabase
3. Runs `CodeIssueAnalyzer` on the file
4. Detects issues (security, quality, style)
5. Calculates quality score
6. Returns issues with line numbers
7. Frontend displays with highlighting!

## Example Analysis:

If a file has:
- 1 exposed API key (high severity)
- 3 missing type hints (warning)
- Score = 100 - 15 - 15 = **70**

## Features:

âœ… **Accurate scores** - Based on real code analysis  
âœ… **Issue detection** - Security, quality, style issues  
âœ… **Line numbers** - Know exactly where problems are  
âœ… **On-demand** - Fresh analysis each time  
âœ… **Visual highlighting** - See issues in code  

## Test It:

1. Click "View File" on any file
2. See accurate quality score in console
3. See highlighted issues in the code viewer
4. Quality scores update based on real findings!

The system now analyzes files in real-time and assigns accurate quality scores!
