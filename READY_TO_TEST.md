# âœ… ENHANCED FILE VIEWER - READY TO TEST!

## ðŸ”§ What I Just Fixed:

### Enhanced Path Matching (4 strategies):
1. **Exact match** - normalized paths
2. **Suffix match** - checks if path ends with stored path
3. **Filename match** - matches just the filename
4. **Case-insensitive match** - handles different cases

### Added Debugging:
- Logs all available files when a file is not found
- Shows exact paths being requested vs available
- Multiple fallback strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ TEST NOW:

### 1. Refresh Browser
- Go to http://localhost:5175
- Press Ctrl+R (or Cmd+R) to refresh

### 2. Click "View File" Again
- The new matching logic should find your files

### 3. Check Backend Logs
In the terminal where `uvicorn` is running, you should now see:
```
=== File Download Request ===
Requested file_path: '...'
Total files in metadata: X
First 10 available files:
  [1] relative_path='...' path='...' name='...'
...
```

### 4. If It Still Fails
The logs will show ALL available files so we can see exactly what paths exist.

## ðŸš€ Try It!
Refresh your browser and click "View File" on any file. It should work now with the enhanced matching!

If it still fails, share the backend log output and I'll fix the exact path issue.
