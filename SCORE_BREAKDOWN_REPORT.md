2. Open the application in your browser
3. The score breakdown graphic will show with mock data
4. **Watch the smooth expansion animations!**

#### **Option 2: With Real API (If Backend Running)**
1. Start backend: `cd Backend && source ../venv/bin/activate && uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Enter any GitHub repository URL
3. Click "Analyze Repository"
4. **Watch the graphic expand with real data!**

#### **Option 3: Run Tests**
```bash
cd Frontend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:ui            # Run with UI
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage
```

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Initial State**: Shows loading spinner
2. **Data Loading**: Smooth fade-in with scale animation
3. **Score Animation**: Numbers count up from 0 to target values
4. **Radar Chart**: Expands smoothly with data points animating
