# 🎉 FILE VIEWER IS WORKING!

## ✅ What I Fixed:

1. **Fixed Supabase configuration** - It was looking for .env in wrong location
2. **Supabase now connected** - Can access repository with 40 files
3. **File download working** - Successfully tested and confirmed

## 🎯 Current Status:

- ✅ Backend running: http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Supabase connected: 1 repository with 40 files  
- ✅ File download endpoint: Working!
- ✅ Files ready for embedding: True

## 🧪 Test It Now:

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5175
2. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. The File Analysis section should show **40 files** from your repository
4. **Click "View File"** on any file
5. **It should work!** 🎉
