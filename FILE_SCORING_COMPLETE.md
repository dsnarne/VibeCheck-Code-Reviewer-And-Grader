# âœ… FILE QUALITY SCORING COMPLETE!

## What I Added:

### 1. Per-File Quality Scores
- Each file gets a quality score (0-100)
- Based on issues found in the file
- Displayed in the File List UI

### 2. Scoring Algorithm:
- **Start with**: 100 points
- **Subtract 15 points** for each error/high severity issue
- **Subtract 5 points** for each warning/medium severity issue  
- **Subtract 1 point** for each info/low severity issue
- **Minimum score**: 0

### 3. How It Works:

1. Backend analyzes all issues in the repository
2. For each file, counts issues by severity
3. Calculates score based on issue counts
4. Returns score with file metadata

### 4. UI Display:

In the File Analysis section, you'll see:
- **Quality Score**: Shows 0-100 for each file
- **Color-coded**: 
  - 90-100: Green (Excellent)
  - 70-89: Yellow (Good)
  - 50-69: Orange (Fair)
  - 0-49: Red (Poor)

### 5. Combined with Issue Highlighting:

- **Quality scores** show overall file health
- **Issue highlights** show exact problematic lines
- **Both work together** to give complete picture

## Example Scoring:

- File with 0 issues: 100 (Perfect)
- File with 2 errors: 70 (30 points deducted)
- File with 1 error + 3 warnings: 65 (15 + 15 = 30 deducted)
- File with exposed API key: 85 (15 deducted, but serious issue)

## Test It:

1. Refresh http://localhost:5173
2. Check File Analysis section
3. See quality scores for each file!
4. Click "View File" to see highlighted issues

The quality scores and highlights work together to show both the big picture and specific problems!
