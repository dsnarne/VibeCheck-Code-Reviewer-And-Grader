### Frontend (Port 5173)  
- ✅ Server running and responding
- ✅ Build successful

## Issues Found:

⚠️ **GitHub Token Missing**
- This means you can't analyze new repositories
- But you CAN view existing files from the database

## Ready to Use:

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5173
2. **File Analysis section** should show 40 files
3. **Click "View File"** on any file to see content
4. **It should work!** 🎉

## What Works:

✅ View repository files
✅ Download file content from Supabase
✅ Display file code with line numbers
✅ Show file metadata
✅ Error handling when files aren't found

## What Doesn't Work Yet:

❌ Analyze NEW repositories (needs GitHub token)
❌ But you can view EXISTING repository files

## Test It Now:

Go to http://localhost:5173 and try clicking "View File" on any of the 40 files!
