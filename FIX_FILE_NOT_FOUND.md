# ðŸ”§ Fix: "File not found in repository" Error

## Problem
The error occurs because the file path being sent from frontend doesn't match what's stored in `file_metadata`.

## Root Cause
The scoring endpoint returns files with `path` field from `relative_path` in metadata. But the file content API is looking for exact path matches.

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Added Better Path Matching (Backend)
- Added logging to see what paths are available vs requested
- Added multiple matching strategies:
  - Exact match on `relative_path`
  - Exact match on `path`
  - Suffix matching for flexibility

### 2. Added Better Path Detection (Frontend)
- Now tries multiple path fields: `file.path`, `file.relative_path`, `file.name`
- Added console logging to see what file object is being sent

## How to Test Now:

1. **Refresh the browser** at http://localhost:5175
2. The backend should have reloaded with new logging
3. **Try clicking "View File"** on any file
4. **Check console** for new logs showing:
   - What file path is being requested
   - What paths are available in metadata
5. **Check backend logs** (terminal running uvicorn) for:
   - "Looking for file_path: ..."
   - "Available files in metadata: ..."

## Next Steps Based on What You See:

### If you see a path mismatch:
The console will show the exact paths. We can adjust the matching logic.

### If backend says "Available paths: [...]":
Compare that list with what file.path shows in frontend console.

## Try It Now!
1. Refresh browser
2. Click "View File"
3. Check console and report back what you see!
