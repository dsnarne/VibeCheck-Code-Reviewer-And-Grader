# ðŸ“Š TEST RESULTS

## Current Status:

âœ… **Backend**: Running and responding
âœ… **Database**: Has 40 files stored
âœ… **Scoring Endpoint**: Working BUT returns MOCK data

## The Problem:

The `/api/repos/{repo_id}/scoring` endpoint is calling ChatGPT and getting MOCK files back instead of real files from the database.

From the test:
- Database has: 40 real files
- Scoring endpoint returns: 3 mock files (main.py, app.tsx, style.css)

## The Solution:

The backend code should populate files from `file_metadata` but ChatGPT scoring is overwriting it with mock data.

## Quick Fix:

Instead of waiting for ChatGPT, let's load files directly from the database for display!
