# ✅ FILE-LEVEL ANALYSIS FIXED!

## What Was Wrong:

The code was calling a non-existent method `analyze_file_content()` when the actual method is `analyze_file()`.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Changed method call** to use `analyze_file()`
2. **Returns CodeIssue objects** with proper structure
3. **Groups issues** by category (quality, security, style)
4. **Calculates quality score** based on actual issues found

## How It Works Now:

1. **You click "View File"**
2. Backend downloads file content
3. Calls `CodeIssueAnalyzer.analyze_file(file_path, content)`
4. Detects issues like:
   - Exposed API keys → -15 points
   - Missing type hints → -5 points  
   - Code complexity → -5 points
   - Security vulnerabilities → -15 points
5. Returns quality score (0-100)
6. Frontend displays with highlighting!

## Quality Score Calculation:

- **Start**: 100 points
- **Each error/high severity**: -15 points
- **Each warning/medium severity**: -5 points
- **Each info/low severity**: -1 point

## Example:

File with:
- 1 exposed API key (high)
- 2 missing type hints (medium)
- Score = 100 - 15 - 10 = **75**

## Test It:

1. Click "View File" on any file
2. Check console for: "quality_score=X, issues_found=Y"
3. See highlights in code viewer
4. Quality scores now reflect actual code quality!

The system now analyzes each file individually and returns accurate quality scores!
